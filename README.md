If you want you can use sample of database prepared by me. It's already uploaded -> winner.sql. Just import it to mySQL.

After this operation, application is ready to start

## Technologies used
- Java 8
- Spring (Framework, Data)
- JPA(Hibernate)
- mySQL
- .jsp
- Bootstrap
- jBcrypt

## Things to improve
- One of the first things I have to deal with is functionality of searcher input. Currently it takes exact order of teams.
- User should have their personal rating, not only the predictions
- many more
